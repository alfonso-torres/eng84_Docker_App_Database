# Docker Compose Task

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container docker applications. With Compose, we use a YAML file to configure our applicationâ€™s services. And then we create and start all the services from the configuration with a single command. Here is a simple graphical illustration that shows how Docker compose works:

__Task:__

__1.__ Create a docker-compose file `.yml`.

__2.__ Run multiple containers on this task. One for node image and another for the mongo official image to launch our app with /posts working.

__3.__ Create a volume to make data persistent. Docker volumes are same as a portable drive to save data and make it persistent.
